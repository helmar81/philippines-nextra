#### Salary is very low
According to the 2022 Occupational Wage Survey (OWS), the average monthly salary in the Philippines is Php 18,423.00 (US$ 330.08). With the lack of a national minimum wage in the country, the salaries of Filipino workers may vary depending on their location, industry, and skill sets.

Outsourcing work to the Philippines is always an excellent option for small to mid-sized companies that aim to get the most bang out for their buck.

The country’s low labor cost is always a point of interest for people who are looking to expand their operations. A reasonable average income for BPO employees in the country is now around $500 per month.

Compared to professionals based in developed countries like the USA and the UK, professionals in the Philippines earn a much lower annual salary — sometimes even 70% to 90% less — despite having the same responsibilities.

That may sound like it’s a bad thing, but it’s not; it’s actually a win-win situation for both the company and the outsourced labor force.

It’s only natural to wonder why a competitive workforce that’s fluent in English can be hired for pennies on the dollar. Rest assured, this is not because of exploitation or modern-day slavery.

These reprehensible acts are still practiced in many places around the globe, but the BPO industry in the Philippines has taken a solid stance against these and actively supports practices that provide employees with good working conditions and decent wages.

## Geography
The Philippines' cities are spread across the country's approximate 7,641 islands. These islands are divided into three geographical divisions -- Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon. The country has a total of 145 chartered cities.The cities are divided in three ways. Highly Urbanized Cities have a population of over 200,000 and has a minimum annual income. Independent Component Cities fall outside of provincial jurisdiction. ICCs, as they are known, are further divided into six brackets dependent on the city's minimum income. Component Cities are similar to ICCs, with the main difference being that they are under provincial jurisdiction.

There are also a total of 82 provinces in the country and 1,493 municipalities that contribute to the country's population, which is one of the highest in the world. It's likely that these numbers may change over the years, as the newest city of the Philippines, General Trias, was named a city at the end of 2015. Also in 2015, the country announced a planned city -- Clark Green City -- which is expected to attract a population of over 1 million people.

The majority of the country's population live in rural areas. Data from 2010 show that over 54% of the total population live in rural areas, with the remaining percentage residing in the country's urban areas. Despite that, the country still has five cities with populations that have surpassed the 1 million resident milestone, including its most populous city, Manila, which has a population of over 10 million people. Six cities in the country have populations that have exceeded half a million.

## Family

 Filipina single moms face unique challenges as they raise their children on their own. Here are some things to consider:

Financial struggles: Many single moms in the Philippines struggle to make ends meet as they raise their children on a single income. They may need to work long hours or multiple jobs to provide for their families.

Social stigma: Single motherhood is often stigmatized in Filipino society, and single moms may face discrimination and judgment from others.

Childcare: Finding affordable and reliable childcare can be a challenge for single moms, especially if they work long or irregular hours.

Emotional support: Single moms may feel isolated and unsupported as they navigate the challenges of raising their children on their own. It's important for them to have a strong support network of friends and family members who can offer emotional support and practical help.

Despite these challenges, many Filipina single moms are able to provide their children with loving homes and successful futures. It's important to acknowledge and support their hard work and dedication.
