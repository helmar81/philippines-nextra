Don't be discouraged if you're not seeing a ton of options on Booking.com or Airbnb!  While those are popular choices, they might not show all the hidden gems a place has to offer. Here's a secret weapon for finding affordable lodging: Google Maps.

Using Google Maps for accommodation can be a game-changer. Here's why:

Wider Search: Google Maps pulls information from a broader range of sources than just major booking platforms. This means you might find smaller guesthouses, bed and breakfasts, or even unique rentals that aren't listed elsewhere.
Local Gems: It can unearth hidden gems that are popular with locals but haven't gotten on the big travel websites yet. These can offer a more authentic experience and potentially better value for your money.
Direct Contact: Sometimes, Google Maps shows independent accommodations that you can contact directly. This can lead to negotiating a better rate or getting insider tips from the owner.
Here's how to get started:

Open Google Maps and search for your destination.
Zoom in on the area where you want to stay.
Look for icons that indicate hotels, guesthouses, or vacation rentals.
Click on an icon to see the property details, including reviews and sometimes even a website or phone number to contact the owner directly.
By using Google Maps alongside Booking.com and Airbnb, you'll open up a whole new world of affordable and interesting lodging options for your trip!
